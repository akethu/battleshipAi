## Gameplay

On clicking 'Start', the ships are set up automatically for both the opponent and yourself. Once done you can start playing right away. 
Clicking on the white spaces in the opponent's region will drop a bomb at that location. If it's a hit, then the space will turn red, if not, it'll turn blue.
The opponent subsequently attacks you randomly, yet strategically. Beat the opponent by destroying the 5 different sized ships.

## Current Highlights

Main features of Battleship Ai:

- Automatic placement of ships for both the opponent and the player.
- Built-in logic which helps the AI opponent play randomly, yet strategically.
- Auto screen lock.
- Auto control lock.

## Upcoming Features

Apart from the above highlights, I am soon to make the game even more awesome with the following features:

- Mobile compatibility.
- Manual placement of ships.
- Change of colours to make the game board look more pleasing.
